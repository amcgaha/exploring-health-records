# Recommendations
1. Hire Medical Staff for Staff Training. Only two years where we've done this. In 2017, 33 percent of those visits showed cold or flu symptoms! This could allow us to keep more people from getting sick.
2. Monitor staff intensely during Session 1. Cold and flu symptoms present in health center records almost every year during Session 1. That means that every year, at least one staff member is likely sick with a respiratory infection during Session 1. The most was in 2018, when 5 staff visits out of 16 (33%) reported cold or flu symptoms.

We can also say that we don't have evidence that respiratory infections are consistently widespread among staff. In 2018, there might have been many staff infected with something, but we can't be sure. 

The lesson is that even if we aren't looking for cold or flu infections during the first session, one staff member is probably sick! During this time, we have the opportunity to use monitoring and interventions to control the spread of infectious diseases. 

3. Session 2 Staff: If there is an early outbreak, it will probably become clear in Session 2 as more patients, particularly staff, present to the health center. More than just a few staff visits will be cause for concern, because the trajectory could reach as many as 20 visits, possibly more. That could imply a heavy burden of disease for staff. Stronger interventions may be required at this point, such as isolating groups of patients for sleeping and meals. 42 percent of staff visits showed symptoms. 


4. Session 2 campers: 
The takeaway for decision-makers is that respiratory infections seem to always be present in Session 2, and that the number of visits is fairly consistent year-to-year. It's important to take preventative measures, monitor, intervene when necessary. The lesson from Session 2 is that infections are probably present even if we're not looking for them. 

Overall, campers don't vary between sessions all that much. Stick within 15-20 percent of visits range. Staff vary much more. Variance in Session 1 and 5 doesn't mean much because there isn't much data, but variance in Session 2 reveals that significant outbreaks may have occured in certain years.

5. Session 3
Viewed year by year, we can tell that Session 3 always presents cold and flu symptoms for staff. Often, the number turns out to be roughly one visit per day for the first half of the session. In 2019, however, that number was doubled. There was a staff visit for every day of the session and then some. 

Nearly a third show cold and flu symptoms. On average, about 31 percent of staff visits in Session 3 show cold and flu symptoms. This is also the most consistent of all sessions, with the lowest standard deviation of about 14 percent.

As the plot shows, the average does tend to decline from Session 2, where close to 43 percent of visits showed symptoms. More data and a deeper analysis are required to judge the decline itself. What we can say is that staff infections appear to persist through Session 3, especially the first half. In this time, staff can present between 15 and 48 percent of visits with cold and flu symptoms.

Camper visits are consistent across Session 3 -- and across all sessions.
With remarkable consistency, an average of 20 percent of camper visits in Session 3 show symptoms. Two outliers can be found, technically, but the spread looks consistent with other sessions.

How should we interpret this fact? We can say that Session 3 visits appear consistent both with other sessions (maintaining an average of between 15 and 20 percent all summer) and between years. Together, these observations suggest that the percent of camper visits showing symptoms remains stable across the summer.

This stability is significant, because it's not what a first look would show. When we look at the sum of all visits for campers, we get a plot that is skewed by the natural pattern in total visits across the summer. Have a look at the sum, which shows all of the top categories shifting together across the summer. Notice, too, the high correlations below the plot.

When looking at relatively stable data like this, we can also plan to use it for comparison. As we are developing best practices for the next summer, we can use past data to understand how our policies and plans have impacted the level of illness at camp and how confident we can be in that assessment. 

In more technical terms, we can use this to create a data model (likely assuming a normal distribution) and apply statistical methods to guage whether the outcome was more likely to be the result of random chance or the result of our preparations.
