# Recommendations
1. Hire Medical Staff for Staff Training. Only two years where we've done this. In 2017, 33 percent of those visits showed cold or flu symptoms! This could allow us to keep more people from getting sick.
2. Monitor staff intensely during Session 1. Cold and flu symptoms present in health center records almost every year during Session 1. That means that every year, at least one staff member is likely sick with a respiratory infection during Session 1. The most was in 2018, when 5 staff visits out of 16 (33%) reported cold or flu symptoms.

We can also say that we don't have evidence that respiratory infections are consistently widespread among staff. In 2018, there might have been many staff infected with something, but we can't be sure. 

The lesson is that even if we aren't looking for cold or flu infections during the first session, one staff member is probably sick! During this time, we have the opportunity to use monitoring and interventions to control the spread of infectious diseases. 

3. Session 2 Staff: If there is an early outbreak, it will probably become clear in Session 2 as more patients, particularly staff, present to the health center. More than just a few staff visits will be cause for concern, because the trajectory could reach as many as 20 visits, possibly more. That could imply a heavy burden of disease for staff. Stronger interventions may be required at this point, such as isolating groups of patients for sleeping and meals.


4. Session 2 campers: 
The takeaway for decision-makers is that respiratory infections seem to always be present in Session 2, and that the number of visits is fairly consistent year-to-year. It's important to take preventative measures, monitor, intervene when necessary. The lesson from Session 2 is that infections are probably present even if we're not looking for them. 

Overall, campers don't vary between sessions all that much. Stick within 15-20 percent of visits range. Staff vary much more. Variance in Session 1 and 5 doesn't mean much because there isn't much data, but variance in Session 2 reveals that significant outbreaks may have occured in certain years.
